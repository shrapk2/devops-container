# devops-container

Just a basic Fedora-based Docker image for facilitating automation containing: `ansible`, `terraform`, `vault`, `az`, `aws`, and `terragrunt`.

Published on Docker Hub: `docker pull shrapk2/devops`

Uses the `latest` tag of the projects for Terraform, Vault, and Terragrunt.  It should be running the latest stable of all the tools.

Happy automating.
